Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle	Tn=n(n+1)/2		1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...
Pentagonal	Pn=n(3nâˆ’1)/2	1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...
Hexagonal	Hn=n(2nâˆ’1)		1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...
It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
